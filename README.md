   We're looking for a logo! If you would like to design one, submit it by
   Friday and we'll vote during the meeting.
 
4. Projects and ideas

   There are a number of ideas we've had as a group that we'd like to realize,
   like a podcast and entries in the ISAL journal. We'll discuss other ideas as
   a group during the meeting.


5. Flash talks

   Students are welcome to give a 5 minute talk about their research or a topic
   they find interesting. Sign-ups for the flash talks coming soon!
