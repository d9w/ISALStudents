### Student Meeting

There is a student meeting during the Friday session (10:30-12). The agenda is:

1. **Student group overview**

   The ISAL Student group formed at the 2016 Alife conference and has been
   meeting regularly on Slack, Discord, and Hangouts since. We discuss articles,
   do presentations, and chat about artificial life topics.

2. **Chair positions explanation and nominations**

   There are five current chairs, and we are looking to add a sixth, Secretary:

   + General Chair
   + Vice Chair
   + ISAL board representative
   + Communications Chair
   + Treasurer
   + Secretary

   Nominations are open until September 15th, and students can announce their
   nominations and introduce themselves during the meeting.
   
3. **Projects and ideas**

   There are a number of ideas we've had as a group that we'd like to realize,
   like a podcast and entries in the ISAL journal. We'll discuss other ideas as
   a group during the meeting.


4. **Flash talks**

   Students are welcome to give a 5 minute talk about their research or a topic
   they find interesting.
