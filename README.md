The [ISAL](http://alife.org/) student group is an international and
interdisciplinary collection of students and post-docs interested in artificial
life. We chat, share resources, and coordinate online, meeting up when we can
at conferences. Our main activities include discussing ALife articles in a
structured way, discussing anything ALife related in a non-structured way,
aggregating post-doc listings, and collectively stressing about our theses.

To give students a chance to interact with faculty doing research they find
interesting in a low pressure setting, we are organizing lunch-time networking
on Thursday. Students will be matched with senior people in the field to have

   The ISAL Student group formed at the 2016 Alife conference and has been
   meeting regularly on Slack, Discord, and Hangouts since. We discuss articles,
   do presentations, and chat about artificial life topics.

2. **Chair positions explanation and nominations**

   There are five current chairs, and we are looking to add a sixth, Secretary:

   + General Chair
   + Vice Chair
   + ISAL board representative
   + Communications Chair
   + Treasurer
   + Secretary

   Nominations are open until September 15th, and students can announce their
   nominations and introduce themselves during the meeting.
   
3. **Projects and ideas**

   There are a number of ideas we've had as a group that we'd like to realize,
   like a podcast and entries in the ISAL journal. We'll discuss other ideas as
   a group during the meeting.


4. **Flash talks**

   Students are welcome to give a 5 minute talk about their research or a topic
   they find interesting. Sign-ups are at the front desk. There are 5 slots for
   talks, and they will be given first-come, first-serve.
